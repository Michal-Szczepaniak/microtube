Have you ever choked on the **QNetworkAccessManager** to download **large files and also resume downloads   
automatically** ? I did , So thats why I created this small library which made my day easier and so I   
think it will make yours too. :heart: This small library contains the **QEasyDownloader** class which   
downloads files that you queue and also automatically resumes the downloads (**Partial Download** ?).   
**QEasyDownloader** also handles **network interruptions** automatically! :dog: And the best part is ,   
**its just a source and header file!** :cat:

### Features
* In-Built Download Queue support :heart:
* Automatically Resumes Downloads , can be disabled if the user wants to! :dog:
* Automatically handles **Network Interruptions**. :cat:
* **Pause** and **Resume** Downloads like a charm. :rocket:
